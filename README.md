# Minimap Zoom
Zooms minimap for AoE2 so it can be used for a second monitor.

## Installation
* Clone repo
* Open Minimapzoom.sln
* Build and run

## Warning
This will probably only work accurately with the game running fullscreen at a resolution of 1920x1080. To have this work on a custom resolution,
modify the Rectangle on line 54 of Form1.cs.
